At CPS lab I work as a Research Software Engineer where I work in Python and code on a underwater submarine robot. 
I work on the autonomous features for the robot like to guide it underwater without the need of a controller. Also, making the robot to have the ability to detect pollution underwater with using TensorFlow lite built for the Raspberry Pi and trained images model.
